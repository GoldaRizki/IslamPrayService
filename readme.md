# PRAY AS A SERCIVE

### Overview

This is my 'just-for-fun' backend project using Exspress. The reason why I made this project is to learn more about nodeJs technology and how to make a good design pattern on it. I also have a plan to continuing this project by developing another project and make this project as a microservice.
